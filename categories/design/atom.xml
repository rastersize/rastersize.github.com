    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have redesigned this site again as I were not happy with the old look =). This time I took the liberty of creating a custom theme instead of just dumping an extreme amount of CSS rules into the <code>styles.css</code>. The custom theme approach probably required more effort than just hacking the classic theme but I am hoping it will prove easier to maintain and update.</p>

<p>Stuff left to fix are the code blocks which currently look quite awful, as well as the tables. That will have to wait though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So far I must say I like the pen but the Mac OS X application needs to be completely redesigned. It looks and acts terrible. What else can you say when it asks you to draw on your screen to calibrate the pressure sensitivity. Copy-paste job from their more traditional tablets maybe?</p>

<p><img src="/images/Inkling_Sketch_Manager-Draw_here.png" title="width height title text" ></p>

<p>No it is not pretty.</p>

<p>I will try and post what I think of the pen when I have used it some more. Check this space for a new blog post on the subject in the future!</p>
