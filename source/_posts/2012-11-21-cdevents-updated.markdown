So my ‚Äúold‚Äù framework [**CDEvents**](http://rastersize.github.com/CDEvents/) turned two and a half less than a month ago üéâ and today it got updated to a whooping version 1.2.0. This brings the power of ARC and blocks (which have been in the `develop` branch for quite some time). It also raises the OS X deployment target to 10.6 and drops support for the now deprecated garbage collection.

Thanks to [JustSid](https://github.com/JustSid), [tonyxiao](https://github.com/tonyxiao) and [dwlnetnl](https://github.com/dwlnetnl) for their contributions and helping to squash some bugs as well as improve the framework.

You can get it from its GitHub page, [rastersize/CDEvents](https://github.com/rastersize/CDEvents), and the [API documentation](http://rastersize.github.com/CDEvents/docs/api/) has been updated.

(The project is still [licensed](https://github.com/rastersize/CDEvents/blob/develop/LICENSE) under the MIT license.)
