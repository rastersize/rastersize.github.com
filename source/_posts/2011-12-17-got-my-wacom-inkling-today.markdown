So far I must say I like the pen but the Mac OS X application needs to be completely redesigned. It looks and acts terrible. What else can you say when it asks you to draw on your screen to calibrate the pressure sensitivity. Copy-paste job from their more traditional tablets maybe?

No it is not pretty.

I will try and post what I think of the pen when I have used it some more. Check this space for a new blog post on the subject in the future!
