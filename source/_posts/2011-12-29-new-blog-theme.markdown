I have redesigned this site again as I were not happy with the old look =). This time I took the liberty of creating a custom theme instead of just dumping an extreme amount of CSS rules into the `styles.css`. The custom theme approach probably required more effort than just hacking the classic theme but I am hoping it will prove easier to maintain and update.

Stuff left to fix are the code blocks which currently look quite awful, as well as the tables. That will have to wait though.
